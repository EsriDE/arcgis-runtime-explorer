# arcgis-runtime-explorer
This is a tool from developers for developers. The main focus is to give ArcGIS Runtime developers a tool to visualize and evaluate mobile caches very quickly.

## Requirements
[Runtime WPF](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/system-requirements.htm)

## How to start
The application can currently handle two ArcGIS Runtime data formats
* Mobile Geodatabases (*.geodatabase)
* Mobile Map Packages (*.mmpk)

And there are two ways to read these file formats
* Start the application and load a file
* Open a cache file with the application

#### Start the application and load a file
![Menu - Open Folder](https://github.com/EsriDE/arcgis-runtime-explorer/blob/master/docs/mainmenu_openfile.png)

Select a cache you want to load into the application and watch the result

#### Open a cache file with the application

In Windows Explorer, right click on the file you want to load and select _Open_ in the context menu.
Choose the _ArcGIS Runtime Explorer_ as application to load this file. 
Select the option _Always open with this application_ if you want to open files by double clicking in future.
Clicking _OK_ opens the _ArcGIS Runtime Explorer_ and directly loads your cache.

## Have a view
