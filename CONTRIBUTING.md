# How to contribute to ArcGIS Runtime Explorer
:+1: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

This project was initialized by a handful of developers who did not want to write their own ArcGIS runtime application for each mobile cache, but instead have an application that makes it easy to sift and evaluate caches.
Therefore, this program is a tool for help. It is not perfect. Not yet. But it can be that through you.

We are really interested in making our tool better. Therefore, we are open to improvements, ideas, implementations, and we will consider them as much as we can.

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/EsriDE/arcgis-runtime-explorer/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/EsriDE/arcgis-runtime-explorer/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If available, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  
## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Submitting changes

Please send us a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/EsriDE/arcgis-runtime-explorer/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

If existing, please mention the issue number you are refering to.

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of our tool will generally not be accepted.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as an issue on GitHub. We will discuss.

Thanks, you are great! :+1:
